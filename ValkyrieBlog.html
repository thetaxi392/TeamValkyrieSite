			<p class="subhead-text"><u>8 March 2022 Entry: Getting close...sign up info here!</u></p>
			<p class="blogtext">It's hard to believe, but the real season, Freestyle season, is upon us!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">Here is step-by-step guide on how signups will run, and things you can do to make the process as seamless as possible!</p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Step 1:</u> Go to the <a href="https://www.usawmembership.com/">USA Membership Website</a> and create an account (if you've already bought or renewed your card, go to Step 3)</li>
					<p></p>
					<li><u>Step 2:</u> Purchase your membership (if possible, please affiliate your membership with Team Valkyrie Wrestling Club). You can find a link to step-by-step 
					instructions <a href="https://www.usawmembership.com/help/category/3/question/14">here.</a></li>
					<p></p>
					<li><u>Step 3:</u> All other sign-up stuff will happen on site, but after you get the USA Card, make sure to keep the USA Card number and link to the USAW Membership website. Please make sure
					to bring names, addresses, phone numbers, emergency contact info, etc. Please also include insurance information. We will get that info on-site this season.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li><u>Step 4:</u> Please bring the money for the season fee in cash or check. We will have last season's t-shirts for sale, they come in purple or gold and they have the logo from the front 
					of the website (not including the wrestlers, just the logo) on the front of the shirt. The purple will sell for $8, the gold sells for 5, and you can get one of each bundled for $10. 
					</li>
					<p></p>
					<li><u>Step 5:</u> I will have USAW waivers on site for parents to sign, if a parent can't come it's ok, I will send the forms home to sign with the girls after the first practice.</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="blogtext">That's all you'll need to do! We like to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
			<p class="blogtext">The practice room is located behind the stage in the big gym. We will do sign-ups either on the stage or in the hallway next to the wrestling room. There are several ways to enter but
			if you can't get into the building, send a message to our Facebook Messenger and someone will come to help.</p>
			<p class="blogtext">We can't wait to see all of you, we've been following your progress and we couldn't be more proud of every single wrestler who trained with us last year. Everyone has goals of
			different sizes, and we hope that you feel Team Valkyrie helped you achieve them.</p>
			<p class="blogtext">If you have additional questions, please submit them to us on the <a href="ValkyrieContact.html">Contact</a> form. See everyone on Monday!</p>

			
			<p class="subhead-text"><u>5 February 2022 Entry: Postseason!</u></p>
			<p class="blogtext">Districts time is here! Congratulations to all of you on an amazing regular season. We've been watching all of the results pour in and we couldn't be prouder of all of your success, whether it's winning your first match, medal, or tournament. Can't wait to see you leave it all out there!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">Many exciting things are coming up, including the start of Freestyle season in 6 weeks! You still have high school season to finish, but we hope you're planning on joining Team Valkyrie this spring to raise your wrestling to another level. We accept everyone from all age groups and skill levels. We have a proven track record of producing high-level freestyle wrestlers, and hopefully you'll be the next!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">Another advantage of joining Team Valkyrie is the fact that all of the coaching staff also coach for the National Team! If you've been looking for more girls wrestling opportunities and aren't sure where to go, we've introduced dozens of girls to the national circuit of tournaments. That may sound intimidating, but you're closer to that level than you think!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">If you have any specific questions our site doesn't address, go to the contact us tab and ask away, we're always happy to hear from parents who want to learn about the best all-girls wrestling club in the area. Watch for more information (including GEAR ANNOUNCEMENTS) coming soon!</p>
			
			<p class="subhead-text"><u>19 December 2021 Entry: Website Up and Running!</u></p>
			<p class="blogtext">Hi! My name is Josh Bauer and I'm the Head Coach for Team Valkyrie. We are an all-girls freestyle wrestling club located in St. Louis, MO. I'm happy that the internet has brought you to this site to find out more information about us, who we are and what we have to offer.</p> 
			<p class="blogtext">Girls wrestling is the fasting high school and college sport in the United States, and we are here to help young women grow a love for the sport and help them reach their goals, whether it be to win a match, win a title, earn a college scholarship, or gain valuable leadership skills to serve them throughout life. We help girls of all ages and skill levels reach another level within their wrestling.</p> 
			<p class="blogtext">The biggest benefit to wrestling for Team Valkyrie, however, is the camaraderie. We have had over 50 girls each season since 2019, and we're only getting bigger! Our growth has continued with ZERO ADVERTISING. Most everyone learns about Valkyrie through word-of-mouth, and this is by design. This shows that the community trusts us to help their daughters reach new heights through wrestling.</p> 
			<p class="blogtext">One of the most rewarding things for me as a coach is to see the girls from Valkyrie talk to one another and have fun cheering each other on even though they're from different schools. The bonds the girls share through this club show in their wrestling, because when others have the same goals and support each other, we all succeed and stick through it all!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">If you are interested in learning more about Team Valkyrie, please go to out <a href="ValkyrieContact.html">Contact</a> page and join our mailing list, or if you have questions, just fill out the comment section and I will respond to you as soon as possible!</p>
			<p class="blogtext">Here is a video from Wrestle Like A Girl that shows what can happen when a girl dedicates herself to wrestling (specifically freestyle)</p>
