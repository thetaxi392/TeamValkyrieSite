			<p class="small-text">"Team Valkyrie has been an amazing experience for my daughter. (Jaycee Foeller) The coaches have gone and beyond. They have taught fundamentals. Many techniques, and most of all confidence. We have traveled many of miles and have done many, many tournaments with them.  Never have been disappointed with any of them. They give it their all. Want growth and see results? Give them a try."</p>

			<p class="small-text">"When I started wrestling three years ago, I wasn’t anything special. I started with folk style at my high school, then after regular season found Valkyrie. I decided to give whatever free style was a try and try to gain a little wrestling knowledge. When I first went there I just thought ‘cool, a wrestling club for just females.’ However, as I’ve grown in this sport and had a few more seasons both in folk and free style, I’ve come to realize how lucky I was to stumble upon Valkyrie. It’s taught me so much; moves, how to have fun at practice and let loose a little, a whole other style, and how to feel comfortable and not rushed or pressured on bottom. Not only has it done all that for me, but it changed and elevated my wrestling style each year to something I never knew I could achieve. Valkyrie has the unique quality of being a girls only club, which can be very comforting for girls just starting out, feeling like they have their own non judgement, boy free space in a male dominate sport. Not only has Valkyrie done all this and taught me this, but it has also introduced me to one of my favorite coaches, allowed me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, travel with friends and make a ton of memories, but it also introduced me to my best friend. I would 10/10 recommend this club for any age girl who’s interested in the sport of wrestling. The coaches are hands on, it’s always a good time, your girls will get solid workouts, and hopefully like me, make friends from all over the state!"</p>

			<p class="small-text">"My daughter loves being a member of Team Valkyrie STL Women’s Wrestling. Team Valkyrie is the Premier Club for Girls Freestyle Wrestling in the area, you will not find an All-Girls Academy anywhere that specializes in the only style of wrestling for women at the College level. On any given day you will have multiple State Champions and Placers getting after it or helping new girls accomplish their goals. I cannot thank the Coaches enough for their selfless dedication, they travel at their own expense to coach our daughter at all tournaments on the roster. The instructors not only care about wrestling but truly care for the girls on and off the
mat. Their passion to grow the sport, partnered with the desire to help each girl reach their potential makes Team Valkyrie the only choice for our daughter."</p>
